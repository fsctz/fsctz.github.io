Currently, I am a first-year Ph.D candidate of [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Wanchun Dou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/douwanchun/index.htm). I received my M.Sc. Degree in School of Software in Jue. 2023 from [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://www.nuist.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaolong Xu](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/xuxiaolong/zh_CN/index.htm). Before that, I was an undergraduate student from [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://www.nuist.edu.cn/) and received my B.Eng. Degree in Computer Science and Technology in Jue. 2020.

My research interests lie in *Edge Intelligence*, including but not limited to distributed edge inference, heterogeneous edge training, and resource allocation in edge computing systems.
